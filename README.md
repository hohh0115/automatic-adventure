# About Music
My first project, including the usage of PHP, MySQL, and Javascript.
In the coming furture, I would alter the script to be more "clean" and "readable" once I am more familiar with OOP than I do now.
This is just a simple project, using Bootstrap as the main framework of my website and after I learn more about PHP and MySQL, the tedious script was changed into a more concise one. I know there is a lot of room for improvement, but now I am quite proud of what I've achieved.
